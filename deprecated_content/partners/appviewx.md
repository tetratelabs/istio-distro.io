Container security can get complicated. In order to take full advantage of the benefits of automation available in 
modern application deployments, organizations need an efficient and reliable mechanism for deploying certificates and 
keys for applications hosted in a container infrastructure.

AppViewX CERT+ platform helps enterprises discover and manage certificates, and automate the entire lifecycle of their 
internal and external PKI in multi-cloud and containerized environments. For Istio users, AppViewX offers an 
Istio-CERT+ plugin that ensures both control and data-plane functions run encrypted with AppViewX-issued certificates, 
providing the mTLS encryption required to secure communication within the mesh.
