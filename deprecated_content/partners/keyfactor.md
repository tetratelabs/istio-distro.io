Keyfactor integrates with Istio to provide complete auditability and control of mTLS certificates in your Istio deployment.

Using the Keyfactor-Istio integration, DevOps teams can leverage Istio without disruption, while PKI and security teams get what they need, including:

* Continuous Visibility: Get a complete inventory of certificates issued via public and private CAs, and centrally track critical data such as locations, keys and algorithms, and expiration.
* Operational Intelligence: Add powerful attributes to certificates beyond the standard X.509 format to search and manage them more effectively (i.e., application owner, cost center, cluster, etc.)
* Policy Control: Enforce consistent certificate issuance policies and workflows from your PKI to comply with internal and external audit requirements.

Keyfactor supports GetMesh's goal to improve Istio user safety by allowing workload certificates to be issued by an observable and trusted enterprise-sanctioned PKI.
