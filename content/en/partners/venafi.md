Engineering and security teams are making Istio the standard for connecting Kubernetes applications with service mesh. Running Istio in production means trusted machine identities – digital certificates – must be used. Venafi makes it easy for developers to access trusted, enterprise-approved machine identities. Security teams get complete visibility and confidence that policy is automatically enforced. Venafi supports Istio with industry standard cert-manager created by Jetstack. GetMesh with Venafi and Jetstack provides an easy way for users to get started with Istio and cert-manager and maintain deployment.
