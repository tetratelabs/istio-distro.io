Instead of using a self-signed root certificate, here we get an intermediary Istio certificate authority (CA) from AWS ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) Private CA service to sign the workload certificates.

This approach enables the same root of trust for the root CA's workloads in ACM Private CA. As Istio signs the workload certs, the latency for getting workload certs issued is far less than directly getting the certs signed by ACM Private CA itself.

The [`getmesh gen-ca`](/getmesh-cli/reference/getmesh_gen-ca) command furnishes the options to connect to ACM Private CA and get the intermediary CA cert signed. It uses the certificate details thus obtained to create the **cacerts** Kubernetes secret for Istio to use to sign workload certs. Istio, at startup, checks for the presence of the secret **cacerts** to decide if it needs to use this cert for signing workload certificates.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need an AWS account and a Kubernetes cluster with Istio installed as well as the following:

- A CA set up in AWS ACM Private CA and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA
- AWS credentials with the `AWSCertificateManagerPrivateCAFullAccess` and `AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess` policy attached. Refer to the [Configuring  the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) documentation on how to set up the credentials.

You can follow the [prerequisites](/istio-in-practice/prerequisites) for instructions on how to install and setup Istio.

### Setting up ACM Private CA

The first thing we need is to set up the ACM Private CA in AWS Console. Log in to your AWS account and follow the steps below to create an ACM Private CA instance.

1. From the services dropdown, select **Certificate Manager** under Security, Identity, & Compliance.
1. Click **Get started** button under Private certificate authority.
1. Select the **Root CA** on the certificate authority (CA) type step, and click **Next**.
1. Configure the CA name (you can use your values here):
    1. For **Organization (O)**, enter **Istio**.
    1. For **Organization unit (OU)**, enter **engineering**.
    1. For **Country name (C)**, select  **United States (US)**.
    1. For **Locality name**, enter **Sunnyvale**.
    1. For **CA Common name (CN)**, enter **getmesh.example.io**.
    1. Click **Next**.
1. Configure the CA key size and algorithm:
    1. Click **Advanced** to expand the options.
    1. Select **RSA 2048**.
    1. Click **Next**.
1. On the "Configure certificate revocation" step, click **Next**.
1. On the "Add tags" step, click **Next**.
1. On the "Configure CA permissions" step, click **Next**.
1. On the "Review" step, select the confirmation check box, and click **Confirm and create** button to create ACM Private CA.
1. Click the **Create** button to create the CAS.

Before ACM Private CA can start issuing certificates, you need to activate by installing a CA certificate. 

1. From the "Private CAs" page, click the **Install a CA certificate to active your CA** link.
1. Change the validity to **365 days**.
1. Select **SHA256WITHRSA** from the Signature algorithm list.
1. Click **Next**.
1. Click the **Confirm and install** button to generate, and install the root CA certificate.

The figure below shows the Private CA page.  Note that yours might look different if you configured your own CA subject name.

### Configure AWS credentials

Ensure you have AWS credentials set up with the `AWSCertificateManagerPrivateCAFullAccess` and `AWSCertificateManagerFullAccess` policy attached on a machine you're accessing the Kubernetes cluster from. Alternatively, if you installed Tetrate Istio Distro on AWS Cloud Shell, the credentials are already set up.

## Creating ACM configuration

We will use a YAML configuration to configure ACM Private CA. Use the YAML below as a template, and enter the ACM Private CA information from the AWS console:
 
```yaml
providerName: "aws"
providerConfig:
  aws:
    # This will hold the ARN value from the Details page of ACM Private CA 
    signingCAArn: "  arn:aws:acm-pca:us-east-2:859085711342:certificate-authority/097162cc-6a9e-47ab-b5e0-fecf32556d6d"
    templateArn: "arn:aws:acm-pca:::template/SubordinateCACertificate_PathLen0/V1"
    signingAlgorithm: SHA256WITHRSA
certificateParameters:
  secretOptions:
    istioCANamespace: "istio-system" # namespace where `cacerts` secrets live
    overrideExistingCACertsSecret: true # overwrites the existing `cacerts` secret and replaces it with this new one
  caOptions:
    validityDays: 365 # validity days before the CA expires
    keyLength: 2048 # length (bits) of Key to be created
    certSigningRequestParams: # x509.CertificateRequest; most fields omitted
      subject:
        commonname: "getmesh.example.io"
        country: 
          - "US"
        locality:
          - "Sunnyvale"
        organization:
          - "Istio"
        organizationunit:
          - "engineering"
      emailaddresses:
        - "youremail@example.io"
```

Save the above file to `aws-acm-config.yaml` and use `gen-ca` command to create the `cacert`:

```sh
getmesh gen-ca --config-file aws-acm-config.yaml
```

The command output should look similar to this:

```text
Kubernetes Secret YAML created successfully in /home/user/.getmesh/secret/getmesh-740905469.yaml
Kubernetes Secret created successfully with name: cacerts, in namespace: istio-system
```

Before continuing, make sure to delete the `istiod` Pod in the `istio-system` namespace to force it to use the created `cacerts`.

### Try it out

If you've labeled the `default` namespace for automatic sidecar injection (see [Prerequisites](/istio-in-practice/prerequisites)), we can then deploy a sample Hello world application:

```sh
kubectl create deploy helloworld --image=gcr.io/tetratelabs/hello-world:1.0.0
```

Wait for the Pod to start and then get the certificate chain and CA root certificate proxies use for mTLS. We will save them in the `proxy_secret` file:

```sh
getmesh istioctl pc secret [pod-name] -o json > proxy_secret
```

The CA root certificate is base64 encoded in the `trustedCA` field. For example:

```text {hl_lines=[11]}
...
{
            "name": "ROOTCA",
            "versionInfo": "2021-02-08 22:42:32.301677034 +0000 UTC m=+0.917666618",
            "lastUpdated": "2021-02-08T22:42:32.310Z",
            "secret": {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.Secret",
                "name": "ROOTCA",
                "validationContext": {
                    "trustedCa": {
                        "inlineBytes": "<base64 encoded value>"
                    }
                }
            }
```

Store the decoded value to the `encodedCA.crt` file and then use `openssl` to decrypt the certificate into a more readable form:

```sh
openssl x509 -text -noout -in  encodedCA.crt
```

The output will include the common name, organization and other values we set in the CAS:

```text {hl_lines=[7,11]}
