### Installing TID addon via the command line

- Check that add-on is available (the AWS Marketplace subscription is required before for TID addon to be deployed in AWS account)

    ```sh
    aws eks describe-addon-versions --addon-name tetrate-io_istio-distro 
    ```

- Deploy TID add-on to the cluster in AWS EKS

    ```sh
    aws eks create-addon --addon-name tetrate-io_istio-distro --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME>
    ```

- The installation will take around 2 minutes. To get the current state use the following command. 

    ```sh
    aws eks describe-addon --addon-name tetrate-io_istio-distro --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME>
    ```

When the add-on is in Active state - you can proceed with deploying applications in Istio-enabled EKS cluster.
